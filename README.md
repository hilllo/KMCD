# A Knowledge-Based Practical Tool For Major-Choosing Decision Making
* This project is for my Bachelor graduation thesis. What follows is the abstract part of the paper.

Abstract：  
Intelligent tutoring system (ITS) aims to provide the learners immediate and customized instructions for their studies[1], usually without intervention from a human teacher. Based on the first-order logic model proposed in [2], an expert system is built in this paper to assist college students or remote learners in choosing their majors according to their learning abilities. The system is written in the logic programming language Prolog. It verifies the correctness of the form model [2], with the graduates from 4 academic years as its input data. With respect to the data, the system is optimized and the arguments are adjusted. In addition, an online system is constructed based on the ThinkPHP network architecture, which enables the remote learners to choose their suitable majors at home.
